What's this?
------------

Engraving Challenges is an open contest in music engraving.  It's aim is to test
music notation programs on real-life scores _in controlled conditions_; we are
particularly interested in how they can handle complex notational challenges, and
what workflows are possible with these packages.


Background
----------

The post-production discussion of a big [Edition]
(http://lilypondblog.org/category/fried-songs/) raised considerable
and renewed interest in the performance of different notation programs
when it comes to complex notational challenges.

There are programs that create very good out-of-the-box scores
while others have difficulties sorting out complex notation
in a satisfactory manner.
On the other hand there are significant differences in how the
tools can handle different parts of an editorial workflow:

- Music entry
- Proof-reading
- Beautification
- Part "extraction"
- Rendering a score in different formats/media
- Collaboration (e.g. between editor and engraver or engraver and proof-readers)

In order to investigate this further we thought of a "challenge project"
comparing various notation programs in a strictly regulated
environment. Demanding tasks of different kind (style, structure,
historic period etc.) form a context in which the performance of each
program can be analyzed.


Goals
-----

While the intent of these challenges clearly *is* to compare the performance of different notation programs, the word "contest" actually isn't a very good description of the project. We're more interested in pin-pointing possible areas for improvement rather than nominating a "winner".  Of course, it is possible that some program will prove superior to others, but we're not going to give participants explicit scores.

We will discuss the results on our [forum](README.md#contact), and we also intend to publish summaries and reports somewhere here in this repository and/or on [Scores of Beauty](http://lilypondblog.org), our Music Engraving Blog.


Requirements
------------

The only requirements for participating in the challenges are:
* being reasonably confident with your notation program and having
  a current version of it (as otherwise the results wouldn't be reliable),
* following the rules listed below.


Rules
-----

1. **Be honest and transparent**  
   The main purpose of these challenges is to analyze the behaviour
   and performance of different notation programs when they are faced
   with certain demanding tasks.
   Although the comparison of different tools is an essential part of
   this project it's not the main goal to nominate a "winner", and it
   doesn't help anybody to play tricks.
2. **Meticulously document progress**  
   Documentation of progress and experiences (good or bad) is essential
   to this project, so *please* tell us everything you notice during your work.
   We use [version control](3-git-introduction.md#what-is-version-control)
   to have a full and transparent project history.
3. **Work in a prescribed order**  
   In order to allow us to make meaningful analyses and comparisons,
   it's important to do everything in a prescribed order, following
   step-by-step instructions from the ["editing workflow"](2-editing-workflow.md)
   document (and specific informations from challenges' repositories).


Ready to go?
