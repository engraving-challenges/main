What's this?
------------

Engraving Challenges is an open contest in music engraving.  It's aim is to test
music notation programs on real-life scores _in controlled conditions_; we are
particularly interested in how they can handle complex scores, and
what workflows are possible with these packages.

Note that this contest is more about comparing engraving software than comparing
individual engravers - we do realize that for the true professionals there is nothing
challenging in the scores we are working on.  However, the point of this project
is to examine how much _effort_ is required to create such scores and how _robust_
the results are (for example, how many corrections are needed when the score is
transposed or paper format is changed).

<!-- TODO:
That's why we'd really like pros to show us how it's done in their software.
In return, we hope to show you new ways of working.
You'll also have the opportunity to learn about Version Control
Any other benefits they get?
Maybe mention that VCS is a subject of research, this would sound serious.

Background
----------

The post-production discussion of a big [Edition]
(http://lilypondblog.org/category/fried-songs/) raised considerable
and renewed interest in the performance of different notation programs
when it comes to unusual notations and other engraving challenges.

There are programs that create very good out-of-the-box scores
while others focus on making it easier to adjust the results
to the engraver's preference.
On the other hand there are significant differences in how the
tools can handle different parts of an editorial workflow:

- Music entry
- Proof-reading
- Beautification
- Part "extraction"
- Rendering a score in different formats/media
- Collaboration (e.g. between editor and engraver or engraver and proof-readers)

In order to investigate this further we thought of a "challenge project"
comparing various notation programs in a strictly regulated
environment. Tasks of different kind (style, structure,
historic period etc.) form a context in which the performance of each
program can be analyzed.


Goals
-----

While the intent of these challenges clearly *is* to compare the performance of different notation programs, the word "contest" actually isn't a very good description of the project. We're more interested in pin-pointing possible areas for improvement rather than nominating a "winner".  Of course, it is possible that some program will prove superior to others, but we're not going to give participants explicit scores.

We will discuss the results on our [forum](http://engravingchallenges.freeforums.org),
and we also intend to publish summaries and reports somewhere here in this repository
and/or on [_Scores of Beauty_](http://lilypondblog.org), our Music Engraving Blog.


Requirements
------------

The only requirements for participating in the challenges are:
* following the rules listed below,
* being at least reasonably confident with your notation program.

We want the results to be reliable and representative, so we'd prefer
that you work with the latest version of your software.  However, if
you believe that the latest version isn't the best choice for the job,
you are free to use another version.


Rules
-----

1. **Be honest and transparent**  
   The main purpose of these challenges is to analyze the behaviour
   and performance of different notation programs when they are faced
   with certain demanding tasks.
   Although the comparison of different tools is an essential part of
   this project it's not the main goal to nominate a "winner", and it
   doesn't help anybody to play tricks.
2. **Meticulously document progress**  
   Documentation of progress and experiences (good or bad) is essential
   to this project, so *please* tell us everything you notice during your work.
   We use [version control](3-git-introduction.md#what-is-version-control)
   to have a full and transparent project history (this is explained later).
3. **Work in a prescribed order**  
   In order to allow us to make meaningful analyses and comparisons,
   it's important that you follow the step-by-step instructions from the
   [_editing workflow_](2-editing-workflow.md)
   document (and specific informations from challenges' repositories).


Ready to go?
------------

Also, feel free to [let us know](http://engravingchallenges.freeforums.org)
that you're participating - we're looking forward to hearing from you!
