# LilyPond Engraving Challenge(s)

The documents in this directory outline the general rules that apply
to our Engraving Challenges. You can also think of it as the
"Contributor's Guide". Please adhere to it as closely as possible,
because otherwise the analyses won't be reliable.

Let's start with a general 

#### "Code of Honor":

1. **Meticulously document progress**  
   Documentation of progress and experiences (good or bad) is essential
   to this project, so *please* tell us everything you notice
   during your work. The appropriate place for such reports is
   your challenge/tool's directory where you can add as many Markdown
   `.md` files as you want.
   The publication of the final analysis is intended on
   [Scores of Beauty](http://lilypondblog.org),
   our LilyPond community blog.  
   We'll work inside a Git repository in order to have a full and
   transparent project history. For the purpose of our challenges it is
   important to make this as concise and fine-grained as possible.  
   If you don't have experience with Git and aren't in the position to
   learn it for this occasion, don't worry. You can ask someone to assist
   you with that.
2. **Strictly follow the step-by-step rules of the challenge**  
   In order to be comparable and to allow us to make useful analysis
   it's important to do everything in a prescribed order. There are
   the general rules in the current directory and possibly additional
   instructions specific to the given challenge. These can be found
   in the challenge's root directory.
3. **Be honest and transparent**  
   The main purpose of these challenges is to analyze the behaviour
   and performance of different notation programs when they are faced
   certain demanding tasks.
   Although the comparison of different tools is an essential part of
   this project it's not the main goal to nominate a "winner", and it
   doesn't help anybody to play tricks.  
   While the text documents of tools like LilyPond can be easily tracked
   by Git this isn't the same with binary file formats. While a LilyPond input
   file always reveals what is in it (what has been changed, what is
   default output) this isn't the same with other file formats.
   So - if you use programs with binary files - please be honest and
   document what you do as exactly as possible. Git's commit messages
   are a very suitable place for such documentation.

#### Contributor's Guide

When you've decided to participate in our challenges and are already
confident with Git you should check out [Git Workflows](git-workflow.md)
to see how to set up your system. If you have never used Git you will
be guided as to what will be the best way to go in your situation.

The [general rules](general-rules.md) are intended as a guideline for
the order or operation when working on an assignment. It is important
to adhere to them so we can reliably compare the progress of the different programs.  
If that structure significantly comes across what is useful with your
tool then you should take this as an opportunity to discuss the
differences in workflows. (Of course you won't be forced then to
use an unusable workflow.)
