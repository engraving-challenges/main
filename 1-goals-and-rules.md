Notes about this file:
- it should NOT contain any too detailed specifics
- it should NOT contain any instructions
- there should be nothing here that the contributor must remember (or will be saearching for later)
- the goal of this document is to let would-be participants a more detailed idea of what the contest is about, what we want to achieve and what we expect from participants.
- in particular, i think we shouldn't talk (or at least talk a lot) about git

# "Code of Honor":

While the challenges are explicitly meant to be comparisons we
deliberately don't want to call them "contests". The main goal of the
project is pin-pointing potential areas of improvement rather than
nominating anyone a winner.

While the intent of the **openLilyLib Engraving Challenges** clearly *is*
to compare the performance of different notation programs we deliberately
did *not* call them "Contests". We're more interested in pin-pointing 
possible topics for improvement than in nominating a "winner".

1. **Meticulously document progress**  
   Documentation of progress and experiences (good or bad) is essential
   to this project, so *please* tell us everything you notice
   during your work. The appropriate place for such reports is
   your challenge/tool's directory where you can add many 
   text files as you want.
   The publication of final analyses is intended on
   [Scores of Beauty](http://lilypondblog.org),
   our LilyPond community blog.  
   We'll work inside a Git repository in order to have a full and
   transparent project history.
2. **Strictly follow the step-by-step rules of the challenge**  
   In order to be comparable and to allow us to make useful analysis
   it's important to do everything in a prescribed order. There are
   the general rules in the current directory and possibly additional
   instructions specific to the given challenge. These can be found
   in the challenge's root directory.
3. **Be honest and transparent**  
   The main purpose of these challenges is to analyze the behaviour
   and performance of different notation programs when they are faced
   certain demanding tasks.
   Although the comparison of different tools is an essential part of
   this project it's not the main goal to nominate a "winner", and it
   doesn't help anybody to play tricks.

#### Contributor's Guide

When you've decided to participate in our challenges you should check out
[setup](2-setup.md)
to see how to set up your system.

The [workflow](3-workflow.md) are intended as a guideline for
the order or operation when working on an assignment. It is important
to adhere to them so we can reliably compare the progress of the different programs.  
If that structure significantly comes across what is useful with your
tool then you should take this as an opportunity to discuss the
differences in workflows. (Of course you won't be forced then to
use an unusable workflow.)
