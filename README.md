openLilyLib Engraving Challenges
================================

The post-production discussion of a big [Edition]
(http://lilypondblog.org/category/fried-songs/) raised considerable
and renewed interest in the performance of different notation programs
when it comes to complex notational challenges.

There are programs that create very good out-of-the-box scores
while others have difficulties sorting out complex notation
in a satisfactory manner.
On the other hand there are significant differences in how the
tools can handle different parts of an editorial workflow:

- Music entry
- Proof-reading
- Beautification
- Creates parts and scores
- Render a score in different formats/media
- Collaboration (e.g. between editor and engraver or engraver and proof-readers)


In order to investigate this further we thought of a "challenge project"
comparing LilyPond ("our" tool) with other notation programs in a strictly regulated
environment. Demanding tasks of different kind (style, structure, 
historic period etc.) form a context in which the performance of each
program can be analyzed.

Each challenge is maintained in its own repository on GitHub:

- [**Schumann: _Estrella_** (from *Carnaval* op. 9)](https://github.com/engraving-challenges/estrella)
- [**Chopin/Godowsky: _Winterwind_** (Study on a Chopin study)]
  (https://github.com/engraving-challenges/winterwind)

When these have been finished we'll consider continuing work with more and different
challenges. We will publish summaries and reports somewhere here in this repository
and/or on [Scores of Beauty](http://lilypondblog.org), our Music Engraving Blog.

If you're interested in participating in this adventure feel free to contact us through
`ul at openlilylib dot org` (or our forum, see below). 
The main requirement you should meet is being reasonably confident with your notation
program and having a current version of it, as otherwise the results wouldn't be reliable.

**Important:** please contact us before starting any work, to ensure that everything will be set up correctly.
