openLilyLib Engraving Challenges
================================

The post-production discussion of a big LilyPond based [Edition]
(http://lilypondblog.org/category/fried-songs/) raised considerable
and renewed interest in the performance of LilyPond when it comes to
complex notational challenges.

While LilyPond's default output is undisputedly of high quality and
extraordinaryly readable it is still not perfect - the amount of
necessary tweaks in said edition is a telling witness.
With LilyPond you enjoy an incredibly high number of issues you're
*not* experiencing. But ironing out the comparably small number of
problems is comparably tedious and difficult to achieve.
So we're quite interested in getting a better picture
of how these two poles actually relate, and how they can be compares
to the user experience with other programs.

In order to investigate this further we thought of a "challenge project"
comparing LilyPond with other notation programs in a strictly regulated
environment. Demanding tasks of different kind (style, structure, 
historic period etc.) form a context in which the performance of each
program can be analyzed.

While the challenges are explicitly meant to be comparisons we
deliberately don't want to call them "contests". The main goal of the
project is pin-pointing potential areas of improvement rather than
nominating anyone a winner.

After a somewhat messy start we decided to maintain each challenge in its own
repository on Github. Currently we're working on our first two challenges,
exclusively piano music:

- [**Schumann: _Estrella_** (from *Carnaval* op. 9)](https://github.com/engraving-challenges/estrella)
- [**Chopin/Godowsky: _Winterwind_** (Study on a Chopin study)]
  (https://github.com/engraving-challenges/winterwind)

When these have been finished we'll consider continuing work with more and different
challenges. We will publish summaries and reports somewhere here in this repository
and/or on [Scores of Beauty](http://lilypondblog.org), our Music Engraving Blog.

If you're interested in participating in this adventure feel free to contact us through
`ul at openlilylib dot org` (or the openlilylib-user mailing list, see below). 
The main requirement you should meet is being reasonably confident with your notation
program and having a current version of it, as otherwise the results wouldn't be reliable.

It would be good if you would also have experience with version control
and can work with our Git repository because you cannot add or update
binary files through the web interface. But that's not a strict requirement and we can assist you with that.

The "rules" of the contest are explained in [general-rules](general-rules.md).  
A concise description (not an introduction) of the Git workflows suggested or required
is in [git-workflow](git-workflow.md).  
A hands-on introduction to version control with Git (from the perspective of music engravers)
will be continuously extended in the [git-introduction](https://github.com/openlilylib/git-introduction/)
repository.

**Important:** please contact us before starting any work, to ensure that everything will be set up correctly.
