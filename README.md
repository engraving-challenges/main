openLilyLib Engraving Challenges
================================

The post-production discussion of a big LilyPond based [Edition]
(http://lilypondblog.org/category/fried-songs/) raised considerable
and renewed interest in the performance of LilyPond when it comes to
complex notational challenges.

While LilyPond's default output is undisputedly extraordinary readable
it is still not perfect - the amount of necessary tweaks in said edition
is a telling witness. So we're quite interested in getting a better picture
of how the actual balance is between a relatively small number of
tweaks and the relative complexity to achieve them.

In order to investigate this further we thought of a "challenge project"
comparing LilyPond with other notation programs in a strictly regulated
environment. Demanding tasks of different kind (style, structure, 
historic period etc.) form a context in which the performance of each
program can be analyzed.

While the challenges are explicitly meant to be comparisons we
deliberately don't want to call them "contests". The main goal of the
project is pin-pointing potential areas of improvement rather than
nominating someone a winner.

If you're interested in participating in this adventure feel free to contact us through
`ul at openlilylib dot org` (or the openlilylib-user mailing list, see below). You should be confident
to be able to work efficiently with your notation program and have a current version of it.
It would be good if you would also have experience with version control
and can work with our Git repository because you cannot add or update
binary files through the web interface. But that's not a strict requirement and we can assist you with that.

The "rules" of the contest are explained in the [`meta`](meta)
folder.
Each challenge is contained in an individual top-level directory, with
some specific information in a README.md file that will be displayed automatically when you open that directory.

**Important:** please contact us before starting any work, to ensure that everything will be set up correctly.
