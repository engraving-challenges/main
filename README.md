[_Scores of Beauty_](http://lilypondblog.org/) Engraving Challenges
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Engraving Challenges is an open contest in music engraving.  It's aim is to test
music notation programs (and music engravers, too) on real-life scores _in controlled conditions_; we are
particularly interested in how they can handle complex notational challenges, and
what workflows are possible with these packages.
