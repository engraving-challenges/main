[_Scores of Beauty_](http://lilypondblog.org/) Engraving Challenges
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is an open contest in music engraving, inspired by discussion about a recently published revised edition of [Oskar Fried's songs](http://lilypondblog.org/category/fried-songs/).  It aims to test music notation programs on real-life scores in controlled conditions; we are particularly interested in how they can handle complex notational challenges, and what workflows are possible with these packages.

If you'd like to learn more, take a look at the [introduction](1-goals-and-rules.md).
You may also read an informal introduction on the [_Scores of Beauty_ blog]
