### Using command line

The command line is a way of communicating with your computer.  It allows you to communicate with computers more directly than using a mouse.

Here are a few tips to get you started:

- When you open the command line for the first time, all you can see is the
  "prompt", which looks like `username@hostname ~/where/you/are $`.
  To run a command, just type it and press `ENTER`.  The command will usually
  produce some output, and then a new prompt will appear.

- The `~/where/you/are` bit in the prompt is called "current working directory".
  All commands you run are executed from that directory.  This is actually quite
  similar to how you usually work with your computer - when you turn it on, you
  can see your desktop and the files that are on it.  To see files that are in
  some other folder, you open that folder.  You can operate on the files that
  you can see in the currently opened folder - just like current working directory.

- To see all files and directories in the current working directory, use `ls` or `ls -l`.

- To go to some other directory, use `cd path/where/you/want/to/go`  
  (note that this path is relative to the directory you're currently in.)

- To go to the parent directory, use `cd ..`.

- If you want to use filenames with spaces and similar special characters,
  you have to use quotes, like this: `cd "folder with spaces in name/subdirectory"`

- Save typing by using autocompletion.  After writing a few initial characters
  of a command (or a path, etc.) press `TAB` to have it automatically completed.
  If there are more than one possibility to complete the command nothing will happen
  first, but pressing `TAB` a second time will present you with a list of all
  possible completions.

- On Linux and MacOS copying and pasting in command line is usually done
  with `Ctrl-Shift-C` and `Ctrl-Shift-V` (instead of `Ctrl-C` and `Ctrl-V`).
  On Windows, pasting is done with `Insert` key.

- pressing `Ctrl-C` in command line tells the computer to abort the command
  that is currently being executed, so you usually don't want to press this
  key combination accidentally :-)
