## Git Workflow

This document provides a concise description of our Git workflow.
It is not intended to introduce you to Git's concepts or tell you
how to achieve a specific task. If you're having problems to understand
or do this please contact us or visit our (work-in-progress)
[Git introduction](https://github.com/openlilylib/git-introduction).

5. **Commit strategies**  
   Please commit very often. We're particularly interested in the detailed
   documentation of the progress, therefore we need this information.
   In general, commit any individual modification or coherent set of
   changes. This may for example be the addition of a complete voice,
   the definition of a page layout or (later in the project) a single
   fixed pitch or positioning. We know that with binary files this will
   bloat the size of the repository because binary files aren't really
   suitable to be version controlled, but we'll accept this for the sake
   of transparency.  
   Use commit messages to leave as much information as possible about
   what you did. You can also use them to store timing information.
   Please make the title of the commit (the "Commit summary" on Github's
   website) as clear as possible because that's what one will see when
   browsing the project history.
   Please don't exceed 50 characters for the message header and 80
   characters for the message body. Use hard line breaks and avoid
   whitespace at line ends.
