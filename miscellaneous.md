### Editing text files

Don't use word processors (like Microsoft Word or OpenOffice) to edit plain text files - it's like driving a truck to take your kids to school.  Instead, use a _text editor_ such as TextMate (on MaxOS), Notepad++ (on Windows), JEdit (on any operating system) or some other.

Note that Windows notepad _isn't_ a reasonable text editor (it doesn't work well with some files) - you have to use something else.  It seems that Microsoft doesn't think that their operating system should include a decent text editor...


### What are `.md` files?

`.md` files are plain text files (similar to `.txt` files) with formatting in [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).  Many websites like GitHub can display Markdown-formatted files nicely formatted.


### Plain text

We say that data is stored in plain text files if these files are human-readable.  In other words, when you open a plain text file in a text editor you will see _text_.  If you see garbage, like this: `xڭ\I#|vܗɐЏLFV&Y\mUe6OKҡ` then it's not a plain text file.

`.txt` and `.md` files are examples of plain text formats.

Plain text files don't require special software to be read and written; they are easy to process.  To get the idea of the difference between plain text files and binary files (such as `.doc` or `.pdf` files), imagine that you have the following two methods to record a piece of text (a poem, or a shopping list):
* writing it down on paper using a pencil,
* using a special machine that chemically imprints the text on a thick metal plate in such a way that it can only be seen when the plate is freezed.

The first method is cheaper, you don't need specialistic tools for it, you may read the text any time you wish, and the paper is easier to carry around.  And if you have a rubber and a pencil (or a pen, or a crayon), you can modify the text as you wish.

The second method... well, it's only advantage is that the machine can produce the prints in color, and they have high resolution.  But the fact that you have to carry a refridgerator with you just to read them doesn't make it very convenient.
