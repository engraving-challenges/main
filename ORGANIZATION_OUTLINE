Interested people land on README
there they read shortly what this is about (should be shortened, and parts moved to goals-and-rules)
they can see the challenges
and the TOC of the instructions, with 1-sentence explanations if necessary.
In general, README should be ~50-70% of its current size

then if they are interested they go to goals-and-rules
they learn more there

then they go to setup and see only the information that is needed to setup stuff.  I.e. information
that is needed for doing regular work should probably not be there.
In other words, setup is where they go to prepare themselves, or when they start another challenge.

Then the actual workflow is described - both git stuff (how to commit) and how to organize the work
(divide into commits etc).  The idea is that when one has successfully set up stuff and  is working
on the challenge, he should only need to look at this one file.

Finally, a short description on how to pull and make pull requests.
